# testpackage

### Overview
testpackage computes and examines the residuals and influential outliers from a linear regression model. 
It contains the following parts: 
```
*hat_matrix: computes leverage and its descriptive statistics. 
*res_3: computes three residuals from a linear model  (standardized,internally studentized, and externally studentized residuals). 
*outlier_influence: computes three diagnostic statistics for measuring influential points(DFFITS, Cook's Distance, and COVRATIO).
*Plot Influential Outliers: includes function plot_dffits, plot_cd, and plot_CVR (plots DFFITS, Cook's Distance, and COVRATIO).
