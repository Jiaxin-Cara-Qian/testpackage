#'@title Sample Data for Demostration
#'
#'@description A common measurement of lung function is the forced expiratory
#'volume FEV, which measures how much air a person can blow out of
#'the lungs in a short period of time. A higher FEV is usually
#'associated with better respiratory function. A group of clinicians is
#'interested in examining the factors which affect FEV1. Data on 654
#'children are available for the following covariates: AGE (A, years),HEIGHT (H, inches),
#'MALE (M=0 for female, 1 for male) SMOKE(Si=0 for non-smoker and 1 for smoker).
#'Each row corresponds to a single clinic visit.
