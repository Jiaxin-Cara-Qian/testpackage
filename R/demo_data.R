#'@title Sample Data for Demostration
#'
#'@description A common measurement of lung function is the forced expiratory
#'volume FEV, which measures how much air a person can blow out of
#'the lungs in a short period of time. A higher FEV is usually
#'associated with better respiratory function. Data on 654
#'children are available for the following covariates:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item{id} - {Observation ID}
#'    \item{A} - {AGE (years)}
#'    \item{H} - {HEIGHT (inches)}
#'    \item{M} - {MALE (M=0 for female, 1 for male)}
#'    \item{S} - {SMOKE(S=0 for non-smoker and 1 for smoker)}
#'    \item{fev} - {forced expiratory volume FEV1}
#' }
